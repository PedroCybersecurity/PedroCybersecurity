👋 Hi, I’m @PedroCybersecurity

👀 I’m deeply interested in cybersecurity challenges and solutions, especially in the role of an analyst where I can apply my skills to protect and secure digital assets. My enthusiasm for technology drives me to continuously explore new tools and methodologies that can enhance security postures.

🌱 I’m currently enhancing my cybersecurity skills at Front Range Community College in Colorado, with a focus on network security, threat intelligence, and security policies. My transition from a background in pharmacy to cybersecurity has equipped me with a unique blend of analytical skills and attention to detail, qualities that are invaluable in the cybersecurity field.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects and initiatives that focus on developing robust security frameworks and practices. I am particularly interested in entry-level opportunities where I can contribute to a team's success while further honing my skills in a practical setting.
